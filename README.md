This is a project called "Cosmonauts' Records"
Created with Angular, didnt use jQuery

Database used - Firebase - realtime updates in the cosmonauts table

I did every input as a string text, so birthdate input can be anything.
Input type Date usually works, but in some browsers, it sucks, so I sticked with input type Text

Design of this "app" was done before anything else in Adobe XD
After Design in XD, I moved on to the functionality of the website.
When I was done with functionality, it was time for my favourite - css (scss)
