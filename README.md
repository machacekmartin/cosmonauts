This is a project for a job - Cosmonauts' Records
Used with Angular, didnt use jQuery (could but didnt)

Database used - Firebase - realtime updates in the cosmonauts table

I did every input as a string text, so birthdate input can be anything.
Input type Date is good, but in some browsers, it sucks, so I sticked with input type Text

I hope you like it.

Design of this "page" was done before anything else in Adobe XD
After Design in XD, I moved on to the functionality of the website.
When I was done with functionality, it was time for my favourite - css (scss)
After I thought I was finished, I realized I had to have some sort of database (not only on localhost).
After many many videos and tutorials on how to do it the way I wanted, came the realisation that I have to rebuild it.
So kept SCSS files, most of HTML files and everything else had to go away.
New project - started building with Google's Firebase - beautiful thing when understood right.
Most of the functions and main variables for controlling the table is in file cosmonauts service
